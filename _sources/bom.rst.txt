Bill of materials
=================================================================================

Printed parts
----------------
1 Block
1 Lever

    Note: Parts should preferably be printed in PETG, ABS or ASA as PLA may creep significantly over time.

Electronics
----------------
There are two board variants included in this repository, either can be used to assemble the InFiDEL.
PCBs and electronic components can be easily ordered via the `Kitspace project page`_ as it can auto-fill carts and get pricing on PCBs and electronic components from common suppliers.

Choose one:

- SMT control board (which is populated; Gerber files and component specifications are included)
- THT control board

Also required:

- Suitable programmer for ATTiny85 (eg USBtinyISP)
- 1 SS495A linear hall effect sensor (or comparable)

Fasteners
----------------
- 2 M3x8 screws (eg ISO 4762 M3x8)
- 1 3x24mm pin (eg DIN 7 3x24mm, for mating lever to the block)
- 1 3x16mm pin (eg DIN 7 3x16mm, for roller bearing in lever)
- 1 3x18mm pin (eg DIN 7 3x18mm, for idler bearing in block)
- 6 M3 threaded inserts
- 1 M6x5 or M6x8 grub screw (eg ISO 4026 M6x5, for pre loading spring)

Pins may be replaced with screws or grubscrews, which may result in decreased precision.

Other hardware
----------------
- 1 6x2mm magnet (eg N35)
- 4 623 bearings (preferably 623-2Z / 623-ZZ)
- 1 Ballpoint pen spring (or other soft 4mm spring)
- Short length of PTFE tube

Calibration accessories
-----------------------
- 1 1.5mm drill bit
- 1 1.7mm or 1.8mm drill bit
- 1 2mm drill bit
- Calipers for verifying drill bit shaft diameter

Drill bits may be replaced with similar diameters.
Measured diameter is to be written to firmware lookup table.
